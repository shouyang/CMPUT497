### How To Run

    - Run the "script.py", it takes no inputs
        - This script uses the filepaths of the files "trainBBC.csv", "testBBC.csv", and "evalBBC.csv" which are hardcoded into the script.

        - This script will print the results of the cross validation procedure to the terminal.
            - I reconmend piping the terminal output to a text file.
            - Since there is no identifier associated with each sample, my script will print these to the terminal generating likely more lines than the terminal buffer.

        - This script will generate two csv files in the local directory.
            - output_testBBC.csv -> As requested per the assignment
            - output_evalBBC.csv -> Used in my analysis for the report, in the same form as the previous file. 

### References

    - I originally used the NLTK classifier before I saw the Carrie's post in the disscusion forum.
        - Hence these references influenced my design.
