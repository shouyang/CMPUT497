The DT

Matsuo NNP

He PRP

For IN

He PRP

the DT

while IN

His PRP$

It PRP

His PRP$

Matsuo NNP

The DT

A DT

Matsuo NNP
lifted VBD

easing VBG

Fresh JJ

Even RB
now RB

A DT

with IN

The DT

When WRB

they PRP

Matsuo NNP

The DT

Matsuo NNP
repeatedly RB

At IN
nightfall NN
he PRP

able JJ

down IN

he PRP

to TO

into IN

He PRP
decided VBD
that IN

with IN

Only RB
the DT

the DT

Because IN

he PRP

more RBR

A DT
spectacle NN

Humiliation NN

While IN

some DT

Matsuo NNP
squeezed VBD

up IN

then RB
he PRP
changed VBD
his PRP$

He PRP
wanted VBD
the DT
arrogant JJ

to TO

so IN
he PRP
aimed VBD

The DT
shot NN
reverberated VBN

Hush NN

Like IN

mischievous JJ

expecting VBG

Matsuo NNP
awaited VBD
reaction NN
from IN

jungle NN

How WRB
stupid JJ
to TO

The DT
jungle NN
did VBD
not RB

The DT

remained VBD

Before IN

the DT
atmosphere NN
reverted VBD

its PRP$
old JJ
normalcy NN

insects NNS

birds NNS
occasionally RB

Matsuo NNP
puzzled VBD

grew VBD
anxious JJ
over IN
the DT
complete JJ
passiveness NN

concluding VBG
that IN
he PRP

the DT
butt NN
of IN

devilish JJ

Five CD

so RB
minutes NNS
later RB
the DT

abruptly RB

stepped VBD
into IN

immediately RB
throwing VBG

He PRP
went VBD
into IN
a DT

a DT

It PRP

jumping VBG
right RB
up RB

he PRP
staggered VBD
in IN
no DT

He PRP
wore VBD
no DT

no DT

a DT

he PRP
lurched VBD
in IN
Matsuo NNP

crossing VBG

in IN
a DT

When WRB
he PRP

Matsuo NNP
noted VBD
the DT

The DT
pockets NNS

The DT
bobbing VBG

was VBD
a DT

so IN
Matsuo NNP
shot VBD
him PRP
in IN
the DT
upper JJ

The DT
marine NN
spun VBD

In IN
the DT

Matsuo NNP

They PRP

Gradually RB

The DT

The DT

Matsuo NNP

With IN
