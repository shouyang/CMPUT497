This DT

puzzling VBG

I PRP
find VBP
that IN

the DT

I PRP

I PRP

this DT

This DT

Since IN

Perhaps RB

The DT

I PRP

Finally RB

We PRP

The DT

me PRP

The DT

even RB

The DT

This DT
right NN

The DT

Many JJ

It PRP

This DT

I PRP

If IN

With IN

When WRB

I PRP

certainly RB
my PRP$

the DT

Our PRP$

the DT

We PRP

in IN
our PRP$

Our PRP$

We PRP

We PRP

that IN

The DT

What WP

The DT

In IN

How WRB

In IN

the DT

slower JJR

In IN

despite IN
the DT

anything NN

There EX

many JJ

quite RB
appropriate JJ
reduction NN

Much RB

the DT
former JJ
extreme JJ

The DT

horror NN

a DT

I PRP

been VBN
reduced VBN

not RB
because IN
we PRP

any DT

but CC
precisely RB
because IN
we PRP

little JJ
control NN

it PRP

In IN
fact NN
, ,
the DT
recent JJ
warnings NNS
about IN

introduced VBN
fears NNS

ambiguities NNS

which WDT
now RB

more RBR

and CC
thus RB
in IN
this DT

science NN

momentarily RB

our PRP$

In IN
fact NN

insofar IN

science NN
generates VBZ
any DT

it PRP
stems VBZ
not RB

much RB
from IN

from IN
the DT
fact NN
that IN
new JJ
unanswered JJ
questions NNS

, ,
which WDT

uncertainty NN

the DT
most RBS
illuminating JJ
example NN
of IN
the DT
reduction NN

fear NN
through IN

is VBZ
derived VBN
from IN
our PRP$

The DT
situation NN
with IN

`` ``

of IN

close JJ
analogies NNS

The DT

was VBD
formerly RB
very RB
much JJ
the DT

I PRP

Nothing NN

His PRP$

I PRP

He PRP

My PRP$
wish NN

Samuel NNP
Beckett NNP

prompted VBN
by IN
simple JJ
curiosity NN

in IN

American JJ
newspaper NN
reviewers NNS
like VBP
to TO
call VB
his PRP$

nihilistic JJ

They PRP

deep JJ
pessimism NN
in IN

Even RB
so RB
astute JJ
a DT

Harold NNP
Clurman NNP

The DT

But CC

me PRP
Beckett NNP

it PRP

that IN

Is VBZ
his PRP$

irrelevant JJ
to TO

is VBZ
it PRP
relevant JJ
because IN
it PRP

something NN
useful JJ

I PRP
knew VBD
that IN
a DT

not RB

in IN
the DT

, ,
the DT

had VBD

Nevertheless RB
I PRP

curious JJ

My PRP$
curiosity NN
was VBD
sharpened VBN
a DT
day NN

two CD

the DT

I PRP

a DT
Jesuit NNP

at IN

When WRB

, ,
the DT

grew VBD
loud RB

told VBD

Beckett NNP
`` ``

That DT

I PRP

is VBZ
at IN

one CD
thing NN
I PRP
can MD
find VB
out IN
when WRB

Beckett NNP

rough-hewn JJ
Irish NNP

The DT
features NNS

distinct JJ

not RB
fine JJ

They PRP
look VBP
as IN

sculptured VBN

an DT

Unruly JJ
hair NN
goes VBZ
straight RB
up RB

standing VBG

high JJ
that IN

gently RB

to TO

it PRP

hair NN

One PRP

it PRP

the DT

For IN
he PRP

the DT

that WDT

the DT

, ,
perhaps RB
of IN

not RB

His PRP$
light JJ
blue JJ

deep RB

the DT

He PRP

The DT

a DT

The DT

light JJ
in IN

with IN
a DT
rough JJ

that WDT

his PRP$

The DT

as IN

His PRP$

We PRP

The DT

For IN

the DT

The DT

For IN
Plato NNP

Aristotle NNP

that IN
all DT

`` ``

Plato NNP

Aristotle NNP

For IN
both DT
Plato NNP

Aristotle NNP
artistic JJ
mimesis NN

in IN
contrast NN

The DT

Erich NNP
