For NNP
Americans NNPS
. .

They PRP
, ,
perhaps RB
, ,
gave VBD
the DT
pitch NN
of IN
their PRP$
position NN
in IN
the DT
preface NN
where WRB
it PRP
was VBD
said VBD
that IN
Eisenhower NNP
requested VBD
that IN
the DT
Commission NNP
be VB
administered VBN
by IN
the DT
American NNP
Assembly NNP
of IN
Columbia NNP
University NNP
, ,
because IN
it PRP
was VBD
non-partisan JJ
. .

The DT
Commission NNP
seems VBZ
to TO
represent VB
the DT
viewpoint NN
of IN
what WP
I PRP
would MD
call VB
the DT
unconscious JJ
liberal NN
, ,
but CC
not RB
unconscious JJ
enough RB
, ,
to TO
invoke VB
the DT
now RB
taboo JJ
symbolism NN
of IN
socialism NN
. .

And CC
here RB
again RB
we PRP
hear VBP
the DT
same JJ
refrain NN
mentioned VBN
above IN
: :
`` ``
the DT
paramount JJ
goal NN
of IN
the DT
United NNP
States NNPS
set VBN
long JJ
ago IN
was VBD
to TO
guard VB
the DT
rights NNS
of IN
the DT
individual NN
, ,
ensure VB
his PRP$
development NN
, ,
enlarge VB
his PRP$
opportunity NN
'' ''
. .

This DT
group NN
is VBZ
secularist NN
and CC
their PRP$
program NN
tends VBZ
to TO
be VB
technological JJ
. .

But CC
it PRP
is VBZ
the DT
need NN
to TO
undertake VB
these DT
testaments NNS
that IN
I PRP
would MD
submit VB
here RB
as IN
symptom NN
of IN
the DT
common JJ
man NN
's POS
malaise NN
. .

And CC
let VB
me PRP
add VB
Murray NNP
's POS
new JJ
book NN
as IN
another DT
symptom NN
of IN
it PRP
, ,
particularly RB
so IN
in IN
view NN
of IN
the DT
attention NN
Time NNP
magazine NN
gave VBD
it PRP
when WRB
it PRP
came VBD
out IN
recently RB
. .

Father NNP
Murray NNP
goes VBZ
back RB
to TO
the DT
Declaration NNP
of IN
Independence NNP
, ,
too RB
, ,
though IN
I PRP
may MD
add VB
, ,
with IN
considerably RB
more RBR
historical JJ
perception NN
. .

I PRP
will MD
reserve VB
discussion NN
of IN
it PRP
for IN
a DT
moment NN
, ,
however RB
, ,
to TO
return VB
to TO
President NNP
Kennedy NNP
. .

As IN
symptomatic JJ
of IN
the DT
common JJ
man NN
's POS
malaise NN
, ,
he PRP
is VBZ
most RBS
significant JJ
: :
a DT
liberal NN
and CC
a DT
Catholic NNP
, ,
elected VBN
by IN
the DT
skin NN
of IN
his PRP$
teeth NNS
. .

Does VBZ
that WDT
not RB
suggest VB
to TO
you PRP
an DT
uncertain JJ
and CC
uneasy JJ
, ,
not RB
to TO
say VB
confused JJ
, ,
state NN
of IN
the DT
public NN
mind NN
? .
? .

What WP
is VBZ
the DT
common JJ
man NN
's POS
complaint NN
? .
? .

's PRP
take VB
a DT
panoramic JJ
look NN
back RB
over IN
the DT
course NN
we PRP
have VBP
come VBN
. .

Has VBZ
not RB
that DT
way NN
been VBN
lit VBN
always RB
by IN
the DT
lamp NN
of IN
liberalism NN
up IN
until IN
the DT
turning NN
back NN
under IN
Eisenhower NNP
? .
? .

And CC
the DT
basic JJ
character NN
of IN
that DT
liberalism NN
has VBZ
been VBN
spiritual JJ
rather RB
than IN
economic JJ
. .

Ralph NNP
Gabriel NNP
gave VBD
it PRP
the DT
name NN
of IN
Protestant NNP
philosophy NN
of IN
Progress NN
. .

But CC
there EX
's VBZ
a DT
subjective JJ
side NN
to TO
that DT
utopian JJ
outlook NN
. .

our PRP$
society NN
have VB
a DT
runaway JJ
, ,
uncontrollable JJ
growth NN
of IN
technology NN
which WDT
may MD
end VB
our PRP$
civilization NN
, ,
or CC
a DT
normal JJ
, ,
healthy JJ
growth NN
? .
? .

Here RB
there EX
may MD
be VB
an DT
analogy NN
with IN
cancer NN
: :
we PRP
can MD
detect VB
cancers NNS
by IN
their PRP$
rapidly RB
accelerating VBG
growth NN
, ,
determinable JJ
only RB
when WRB
related VBN
to TO
the DT
more RBR
normal JJ
rate NN
of IN
healthy JJ
growth NN
. .

Should MD
the DT
accelerating VBG
growth NN
of IN
technology NN
then RB
warn VB
us PRP
? .
? .

Noting VBG
such JJ
evidence NN
is VBZ
the DT
first JJ
step NN
; :
; :
and CC
almost RB
the DT
only JJ
`` ``
cure NN

is VBZ
early JJ
detection NN
and CC
removal NN

One CD
way NN
to TO
determine VB
whether IN
we PRP
have VBP
so RB
dangerous JJ
a DT
technology NN
would MD
be VB
to TO
check VB
the DT
strength NN
of IN
our PRP$
society NN

organs NNS
to TO
see VB
if IN
their PRP$
functioning NN
is VBZ
as RB
healthy JJ
as IN
before IN

an DT
objective JJ
look NN
at IN
our PRP$
present JJ
procedures NNS
may MD
move VB
us PRP
to TO
consider VB
seriously RB
this DT
possibly RB
analogous JJ
situation NN

In IN
any DT
event NN
, ,
whether IN
society NN
may MD
have VB
cancer NN
, ,
or CC
merely RB
a DT
virus NN
infection NN
, ,
the DT
`` ``

we PRP

is VBZ
political JJ

and CC
even RB
medical JJ

Have VBP
not RB
our PRP$
physical JJ
abilities NNS
already RB
deteriorated VBN
because IN
of IN
the DT
more RBR
sedentary JJ
lives NNS
we PRP
are VBP
now RB
living VBG
? .
? .

Hence RB
the DT
prime JJ
issue NN
, ,
as IN
I PRP
see VBP
it PRP
, ,
is VBZ
whether IN
a DT
democratic JJ
or CC
free JJ
society NN
can MD
master VB

or CC
whether IN

rule VB

develop VB
its PRP$
own JJ
society NN
compatible JJ
with IN
its PRP$
own JJ
needs NNS
as IN
a DT
force NN
of IN
nature NN

We PRP
are VBP
already RB
committed VBN
to TO
establishing VBG
man NN

supremacy NN
over IN
nature NN
and CC
everywhere RB
on IN
earth NN
, ,
not RB
merely RB
in IN
the DT
limited JJ
social-political-economical JJ
context NN
we PRP
are VBP
fond JJ
of IN
today NN

we PRP
go VBP
on IN
endlessly RB
trying VBG
to TO
draw VB
the DT
line NN
, ,
color NN
and CC
other JJ
, ,
as IN
to TO
which WDT
kind NN
of IN
man NN
we PRP
wish VBP
to TO
see VB
dominate VB

We PRP
have VBP
proved VBD
so RB
able JJ
to TO
solve VB
technological JJ
problems NNS
that IN
to TO
contend VB
we PRP
can MD
not RB
realize VB
a DT
universal JJ
goal NN
in IN
the DT
immediate JJ
future NN
is VBZ
to TO
be VB
extremely RB
shortsighted JJ
, ,
if IN
nothing NN
else RB
. .

We PRP
must MD
believe VB
we PRP
have VBP
the DT
ability NN
to TO
affect VB
our PRP$
own JJ
destinies NNS
: :
otherwise RB
why WRB
try VB
anything NN
? .
? .

these DT
pages NNS
the DT
term NN
`` ``
technology NN
'' ''
is VBZ
used VBN
to TO
include VB
any DT
and CC
all DT
means NNS
which WDT
could MD
amplify VB
, ,
project VB
, ,
or CC
augment VB
man NN

control NN
over IN

over IN
other JJ
men NNS

Naturally RB
this DT

all DT
communication NN

e.g. FW

or CC
any DT
social JJ
, ,
political JJ

economic JJ

religious JJ
structures NNS
employed VBN
for IN
such JJ
control NN

Properly RB
mindful JJ
of IN
all PDT
the DT
cultures NNS
in IN
existence NN
today RB
throughout IN
the DT
world NN
, ,
we PRP
must MD
employ VB
these DT
resources NNS
without IN
war NN
or CC
violent JJ
revolution NN

we PRP
were VBD
creating VBG
a DT
wholly RB
new JJ
society NN

we PRP
could MD
insist VB
that IN

philosophic JJ
institutions NNS
foster VB
rather RB

But CC
we PRP
can MD
not RB
start VB
off IN
with IN
a DT
clean JJ
slate NN

So IN
we PRP
must MD
first RB
analyze VB
our PRP$

with IN

to TO
the DT
effect NN

each DT

which WDT

correction NN

I PRP

say VB
the DT

as IN

exists VBZ
in IN
America NNP
today RB
. .

At IN
first JJ
glance NN
this DT
appears VBZ
strange JJ

of IN
all DT
people NNS

was VBD
not RB
America NNP
founded VBN

First RB

in IN

the DT

so RB

Socialism NN

us PRP
not RB

truly RB

Some DT

do VBP
indeed RB
work VB

superb JJ

a DT

But CC
the DT
pseudo-capitalism NN

will MD
not RB

Its PRP$
pretense NN
to TO
operate VB

is VBZ
little RB
more JJR
than IN
a DT
sham NN

It PRP
serves VBZ
only RB
its PRP$

stockholders NNS
and CC
poorly RB
at IN
that DT

As IN
a DT
creative JJ
enterprise NN

its PRP$
abilities NNS

primarily RB
in IN
`` ``

creative JJ
enterprises NNS

As IN
to TO

it PRP
is VBZ
notorious JJ
for IN
its PRP$
callous JJ

except IN
where WRB
it PRP
depends VBZ
on IN
them PRP
for IN

The DT
corporation NN
in IN
America NNP
is VBZ
in IN
reality NN
our PRP$
form NN
of IN
socialism NN

vying VBG
in IN
a DT
sense NN
with IN
the DT
other JJ
socialistic JJ
form NN
that WDT

emerged VBN
within IN
governmental JJ
bureaucracy NN

But CC
while IN
the DT
corporation NN
has VBZ
all PDT
the DT
disadvantages NNS
of IN
the DT
socialist JJ
form NN
of IN
organization NN
( (
so RB
cumbersome JJ
it PRP
can MD
not RB
constructively RB
do VB
much RB

unluckily RB
it PRP

the DT

the DT
motivation NN

as IN

So IN
we PRP
are VBP
faced VBN
with IN
a DT
vast JJ
network NN
of IN
amorphous JJ
entities NNS
perpetuating VBG
themselves PRP
in IN
whatever WDT
manner NN
they PRP
can MD
, ,
without IN

to TO
the DT
needs NNS
of IN
society NN

controlling VBG

and CC
forcing VBG

it PRP
a DT
regime NN
representing VBG
only RB
the DT
corporation NN

needs NNS
for IN
survival NN

The DT
corporation NN
has VBZ
a DT
limited VBN

specific JJ
place NN
in IN
our PRP$
society NN

Ideally RB
speaking VBG

it PRP
should MD
be VB
allowed VBN
to TO
operate VB
only RB
where WRB
the DT
public NN
has VBZ
a DT
great JJ
stake NN
in IN
the DT
continuity NN
of IN
supply NN
or CC
services NNS
, ,
and CC
where WRB
the DT
actions NNS
of IN
a DT
single JJ

are VBP
secondary JJ
to TO
the DT
needs NNS
of IN
society NN

Examples NNS
are VBP
in IN
public NN
utilities NNS
, ,
making VBG
military JJ
aircraft NNS
and CC
accessories NNS
, ,
or CC
where WRB
the DT
investment NN

risk NN

would MD
be VB
too RB
great JJ
for IN
a DT
much JJ

other JJ
than IN
the DT

e.g. FW

Thus RB
, ,
if IN
corporations NNS
are VBP
not RB
to TO
run VB
away RB
with IN
us PRP

they PRP
must MD
become VB
quasi-governmental JJ

subject JJ

In IN
all DT
other JJ
areas NNS

urged VBN

the DT

goods NNS
and CC

Proprietorship NNP
Avoiding NNP
runaway JJ

can MD
be VB
done VBN
only RB
by IN
assuring VBG
a DT
humane JJ
society NN
; :

and CC
for IN
this DT
human NN
beings NNS
must MD
be VB
firmly RB
in IN
control NN
of IN
the DT

Such JJ
genuine JJ
human NN
leadership NN
the DT

can MD
offer VB
, ,
corporations NNS
can MD
not RB

It PRP

project VB
long-range JJ

Corporations NNS
react VBP
violently RB
to TO
short-range JJ

Proprietorships NNP

; :

corporations NNS

being VBG
more RBR

Proprietorships NNP

establish VB
a DT

representing VBG
a DT
human NN

thus RB
establish VB
sincere JJ
relationships NNS

Corporations NNS

almost RB

a DT

`` ``
At IN

As IN

however RB

we PRP

Such JJ

it PRP

frequently RB

unnatural JJ
defensiveness NN

The DT

Since IN
