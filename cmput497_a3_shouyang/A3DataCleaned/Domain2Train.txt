Dan NNP

told VBD
himself PRP
he PRP

forget VB
Ann NNP
Turner NNP

He PRP
was VBD
well RB
rid JJ

her PRP

He PRP
certainly RB
did VBD
n't RB
want VB
a DT
wife NN
who WP
was VBD
fickle JJ
as IN
Ann NNP

If IN
he PRP

married VBN
her PRP
, ,
he PRP
'd MD
have VB
been VBN
asking VBG
for IN
trouble NN

all DT
of IN
this DT
was VBD
rationalization NN

Sometimes RB
he PRP
woke VBD
up IN
in IN
the DT
middle NN
of IN
the DT
night NN
thinking NN
of IN
Ann NNP
, ,
and CC
then RB
could MD
not RB
get VB

His PRP$
plans NNS

dreams NNS
had VBD
revolved VBN
around IN
her PRP
so RB
much RB
and CC
for IN
so RB
long JJ
that IN
now RB
he PRP
felt VBD
as IN
if IN

nothing NN

The DT
easiest JJS
thing NN
would MD
be VB
to TO
sell VB
out IN
to TO
Al NNP
Budd NNP

leave VB
the DT
country NN
, ,
but CC
there EX
was VBD
a DT
stubborn JJ
streak NN
in IN
him PRP
that WP

n't RB
allow VB
it PRP

The DT
best JJS
antidote NN
for IN
the DT
bitterness NN
and CC
disappointment NN
that WP
poisoned VBD
him PRP
was VBD
hard JJ
work NN

He PRP
found VBD
that IN
if IN
he PRP
was VBD
tired VBN
enough RB
at IN
night NN
, ,
he PRP
went VBD
to TO
sleep VB
simply RB
because IN
he PRP
was VBD
too RB
exhausted VBN
to TO
stay VB
awake RB
. .

Each DT
day NN
he PRP
found VBD
himself PRP
thinking VBG
less RBR
often RB
of IN
Ann NNP
; :
; :
each DT
day NN
the DT
hurt NN
was VBD
a DT
little RB
duller JJR
, ,
a DT
little RB
less RBR
poignant JJ
. .

He PRP
had VBD
plenty NN
of IN
work NN
to TO
do VB
. .

Because IN
the DT
summer NN
was VBD
unusually RB
dry JJ
and CC
hot JJ
, ,
the DT
spring NN
produced VBD
a DT
smaller JJR
stream NN
than IN
in IN
ordinary JJ
years NNS

The DT
grass NN
in IN
the DT
meadows NNS
came VBD
fast RB
, ,
now RB
that IN
the DT
warm JJ
weather NN
was VBD
here RB
. .

He PRP
could MD
not RB
afford VB
to TO
lose VB
a DT
drop NN
of IN
the DT
precious JJ
water NN
, ,
so IN
he PRP
spent VBD
most RBS
of IN
his PRP$
waking VBG
hours NNS
along IN
the DT
ditches NNS
in IN
his PRP$
meadows NNS

He PRP
had VBD
no DT
idea NN
how WRB
much JJ
time NN
Budd NNP
would MD
give VB
him PRP

In IN
any DT
case NN
, ,
he PRP
had VBD
no DT
intention NN
of IN
being VBG
caught VBN
asleep RB
, ,
so IN
he PRP
carried VBD
his PRP$
revolver NN
in IN
its PRP$
holster NN
on IN
his PRP$
hip NN
and CC
he PRP
took VBD
his PRP$
Winchester NNP
with IN
him PRP

leaned VBD
it PRP
against IN
the DT
fence NN

He PRP
stopped VBD
every DT
few JJ
minutes NNS
and CC
leaned VBD
on IN
his PRP$
shovel NN
as IN
he PRP
studied VBD
the DT
horizon NN
, ,
but CC
nothing NN
happened VBD
, ,
each DT
day NN
dragging VBG
out IN
with IN
monotonous JJ
calm NN

late JJ
afternoon NN
on IN
the DT
last JJ
day NN
in IN
June NNP
, ,
he PRP
saw VBD
two CD
people NNS
top VB
the DT

the DT
south NN
and CC
walk NN
toward IN
the DT

, ,
he PRP
quit VBD
work NN
immediately RB
and CC
strode VBD
to TO
his PRP$
rifle NN

It PRP
could MD
be VB
some DT
kind NN
of IN
trick NN
Budd NNP
had VBD
thought VBN
up IN

No DT

Dutch NNP
Renfro NNP
or CC
any DT

of IN

Morgan NNP
watched VBD
the DT
two CD
figures NNS
for IN
a DT
time NN
, ,
puzzled VBN

When WRB
they PRP
were VBD
closer JJR
and CC
he PRP
saw VBD
that IN
one CD

a DT

, ,
he PRP
was VBD
more RBR
puzzled JJ

ever RB

He PRP
cleaned VBD
his PRP$

left VBD
it PRP
against IN
the DT

picked VBN
up IN
his PRP$
Winchester NNP

started VBD
downstream RB

His PRP$

crossing VBG
the DT

angling VBG

Now RB
he PRP

that IN
both DT

moving VBG
slowly RB

irregularly RB

staggering VBG

as IN

the DT
house NN
ahead RB

them PRP

he PRP
waited VBD
with IN
his PRP$
Winchester NNP
in IN
his PRP$

They PRP
crawled VBD
through IN
the DT
north JJ
fence NN
and CC
came VBD
on IN
toward IN
him PRP
, ,
and CC
now RB
he PRP
saw VBD
that IN
both DT

young JJ

not RB
more JJR
than IN
nineteen CD

twenty CD

They PRP
were VBD
dirty JJ
, ,
their PRP$
clothes NNS
were VBD
torn VBN

and CC
the DT

was VBD
so RB
exhausted VBN
that IN
she PRP
fell VBD
when WRB
she PRP

still RB
twenty CD

She PRP
lay VBD
there EX

making VBG
no DT

The DT

came VBD
on IN

the DT

sat VBD
down IN

his PRP$
gaze NN
on IN
Morgan NNP
as IN
if IN
half DT
expecting VBG
him PRP
to TO

not RB
really RB
caring VBG

Morgan NNP
hesitated VBD
, ,
thinking VBG
that IN
if IN
this DT

a DT
trick NN

it PRP
was VBD
a DT
good JJ
one CD

He PRP
did VBD
n't RB
think VB
it PRP

possible JJ
for IN

The DT
boy NN
licked VBD
his PRP$
dry JJ
lips NNS

He PRP
asked VBD
, ,
`` ``
Could MD

Morgan NNP
jerked VBD
his PRP$
head NN
toward IN
the DT

`` ``

he PRP

Leaning VBG
his PRP$
Winchester NNP
against IN

the DT

he PRP
walked VBD

the DT

`` ``

She PRP

Her PRP$

glazed VBN

She PRP

reached VBN
a DT

at IN
which WDT
she PRP
did VBD
n't RB
even JJ

how WRB
she PRP

Her PRP$
face NN
was VBD
very RB
thin JJ

and CC
burned VBD
by IN
the DT
sun NN
until IN
much JJ

the DT

dead JJ

peeling VBG

the DT
new JJ

under IN
it PRP
red JJ

angry JJ

Her PRP$
blond NN
hair NN

frowzy JJ

her PRP$

torn VBN
in IN
several JJ

her PRP$

so RB
completely RB

out IN

practically RB
no DT

It PRP

have VB
hurt VBN
her PRP
even RB
to TO

, ,
for IN
the DT
sole NN
was VBD
completely RB
off IN
her PRP$
left JJ
foot NN
and CC
Morgan NNP
saw VBD
that IN
it PRP
was VBD
bruised VBN

bleeding VBG

He PRP
picked VBD
her PRP
up IN

sliding VBG
one CD
hand NN
under IN
her PRP$
shoulders NNS

the DT
other JJ
under IN
her PRP$

and CC
carried VBD
her PRP

She PRP
was VBD
amazingly RB
light JJ

so RB
relaxed VBN
in IN
his PRP$

that IN
he PRP

n't RB
even RB
sure JJ

Any DT

suspicion NN
that IN

a DT

Al NNP

dispelled VBN

No DT

Besides IN

she PRP

a DT
sweet JJ

He PRP
put VBD
her PRP
down IN
on IN

couch NN

and CC
going VBG
into IN
the DT

saw VBD
that IN

They PRP

Both DT

there EX

Morgan NNP
filled VBD

went VBD

She PRP

`` ``

as IN

He PRP

wondering VBG
what WDT

The DT

Morgan NNP

Wilson NNP

He PRP

him PRP
struggling VBG

finally RB

Kathy NNP

They PRP

Wilson NNP

He PRP

an DT

That DT

last JJ

what WP

her PRP$

Judith NNP
Pierce NNP

It PRP

the DT
only JJ
thing NN

her PRP
that DT

the DT

hard RB

He PRP
finished VBD
with IN

filled VBD
his PRP$

stood VBD
looking VBG

him PRP

He PRP
had VBD
spent VBN
two CD
hours NNS
riding VBG
around IN
the DT

that DT
morning NN

and CC
in IN
broad JJ
daylight NN
it PRP
was VBD
even RB
less RBR
inviting JJ
than IN
Judith NNP
Pierce NNP
had VBD
made VBN
it PRP
seem VB

There EX

brush NN

of IN
pine NN
that IN
no DT

grow VB
under IN

places NNS
so RB
steep JJ
that IN

But CC
there EX

water NN

There EX
was VBD
an DT
artificial JJ
lake NN
just RB
out IN
of IN

in IN
the DT

of IN

fed VBN

a DT
half NN
dozen NN

that WP

out RB

above IN

Yes RB

there EX
was VBD
plenty NN
of IN
water NN
, ,
too RB
much JJ

and CC
that DT
was VBD
probably RB
the DT
trouble NN

There EX
were VBD
tracks NNS
of IN
cattle NNS
all DT
over IN
his PRP$
six CD
hundred CD

forty CD
acres NNS

The DT
first JJ
part NN
of IN
the DT

was VBD
steep JJ
, ,
but CC
it PRP
leveled VBD
off RB
after IN
the DT
second JJ
bend NN
and CC
curled VBD
gradually RB
into IN
the DT
valley NN

It PRP

hotter JJR
once IN
they PRP
reached VBD
the DT
flat NN
, ,
and CC
drier RBR

but CC
the DT
grass NN
was VBD
better JJR

A DT
warm JJ

played VBD
across IN
it PRP

moving VBG
it PRP
like IN

A DT
red-tailed JJ

flew VBD
in IN
behind IN

stayed VBD
there RB

watching VBG

any DT

rabbits NNS
that IN
they PRP

of IN
the DT

It PRP
took VBD
them PRP
an DT
hour NN
before IN
they PRP
came VBD
to TO
the DT
first JJ
houses NNS
of IN
Kelseyville NNP

The DT
town NN
was VBD
about IN
what WP
Wilson NNP
expected VBD
: :
one CD
main JJ

with IN
its PRP$

a DT

a DT

all DT
dusty JJ

The DT

Such DT

my PRP$

that IN
I PRP

under IN

I PRP

only RB

I PRP

nearly RB
thirty CD

I PRP
went VBD

the DT

in IN
the DT

only RB

on IN

It PRP

I PRP

very RB

only RB
the DT

at IN
one CD

by IN
a DT

Sometimes RB
I PRP

I PRP

turn VB

A DT

three CD

at IN

Drifting VBG

Squatting VBG

as IN

The DT
pulsing VBG
glow NN

they PRP

but CC
I PRP
not RB
them PRP
, ,
their PRP$
presence NN
in IN
the DT

disturbed VBD
me PRP

The DT
clerk NN
paid VBD
them PRP
no DT
attention NN

This DT
impressed VBD
me PRP
, ,
until IN
I PRP
realized VBD
how WRB
limited VBN
was VBD
his PRP$
sphere NN
of IN
influence NN
. .

His PRP$
job NN
simply RB
consisted VBD
in IN
registering VBG
new JJ
men NNS

When WRB
the DT
phone NN
rang VBD
he PRP
answered VBD
it PRP

His PRP$
authority NN
extended VBN
to TO
the DT
far JJ
edge NN
of IN
the DT

, ,
no RB
further RB

None NN
of IN
the DT
men NNS
hanging VBG
around IN
the DT
hall NN
bothered VBD
to TO
speak VB
to TO
him PRP

Baldness NN
was VBD
attacking VBG
his PRP$
pate NN

He PRP
spoke VBD
to TO
me PRP
in IN
a DT
gruff JJ
voice NN
, ,
an DT
affectation NN
which WDT
quite RB
belied VBD
his PRP$
personality NN

He PRP
wore VBD
his PRP$
white JJ
shirt NN
open JJ
at IN
the DT
neck NN
, ,
revealing VBG
a DT
bit NN
of IN
scrawny JJ
pale JJ
chest NN
underneath NN

It PRP
was VBD
obvious JJ
that IN
he PRP
wished VBD
himself PRP
different JJ
from IN
the DT
sort NN
of IN
person NN
he PRP
thought VBD
he PRP
was VBD

But CC
it PRP
was VBD
not RB
easy JJ
for IN
him PRP
and CC
he PRP
often RB
slipped VBD
. .

When WRB
one CD
of IN
the DT
men NNS
in IN
the DT
hall NN
behind IN
us PRP
spat VBD
on IN
the DT
floor NN
and CC
scraped VBD
his PRP$
boot NN
over IN
the DT
gob NN
of IN
spittle NN
I PRP
noticed VBD
how WRB
the DT
clerk NN
winced VBD
. .

I PRP
felt VBD
certain JJ
he PRP
was VBD
really RB
a DT
spineless JJ
little JJ
man NN
. .

His PRP$
hat NN
( (
the DT
cause NN
of IN
his PRP$
baldness NN
? .
? .

) )
hung VBD
on IN
a DT
hook NN
on IN
the DT
wall NN
, ,
and CC
underneath IN
it PRP
I PRP
could MD
see VB
his PRP$
tie NN
, ,
knotted JJ
, ,
ready JJ
to TO
be VB
slipped VBN
over IN
his PRP$
head NN
, ,
a DT
black JJ
badge NN
of IN
frayed JJ
respectability NN
that WP
ought MD
never RB
to TO
have VB
left VBN
his PRP$
neck NN

The DT
morning NN
's POS
tabloids NNS
were VBD
on IN
the DT
counter NN
, ,
and CC
a DT
stack NN
of IN
dog-eared JJ
men NNS
's POS
magazines NNS
. .

On IN
a DT
shelf NN
in IN
the DT
office NN
behind IN
the DT
counter NN
was VBD
a DT
small JJ
radio NN
dialed VBD
permanently RB
on IN
a DT
station NN
which WDT
broadcast VBD
only JJ
vulgar JJ
commercials NNS
and CC
cheap JJ
popular JJ
music NN
. .

Everything NN
about IN
the DT
clerk NN
was VBD
trivial JJ
. .

Once RB
, ,
pressing VBG
him PRP
, ,
I PRP
learned VBD
that DT
his PRP$
job NN
was VBD
only RB
part-time JJ
, ,
in IN
the DT
afternoons NNS
when WRB
nothing NN
went VBD
on IN
in IN
the DT
hall NN
. .

Noticing VBG
my PRP$
disappointment NN
he PRP
attempted VBD
to TO
salvage VB
what WP
scraps NNS
and CC
shreds NNS
of IN
authority NN
he PRP
felt VBD
might MD
still RB
be VB
clinging VBG
to TO
his PRP$
person NN
. .

With IN
distaste NN
I PRP
saw VBD
him PRP
assume VB
a DT
pompous JJ
air NN
. .

When WRB
he PRP
saw VBD
me PRP
coming VBG
he PRP
turned VBD
his PRP$
radio NN
off RP
. .

He PRP
made VBD
a DT
show NN
of IN
rearranging VBG
my PRP$
forms NNS
on IN
the DT
shelf NN
. .

He PRP
would MD
pick VB
up RP
the DT
ringing VBG
phone NN
with IN
studied JJ
negligence NN
, ,
then RB
bark VB
into IN
it PRP
with IN
gruff JJ
importance NN
. .

What WP
limited VBD
knowledge NN
he PRP
possessed VBD
he PRP
forced VBD
upon IN
me PRP
. .

In IN
the DT
mornings NNS
, ,
I PRP
was VBD
informed VBN
, ,
fluorescent JJ
tubes NNS
, ,
similar JJ
to TO
the DT
one CD
above IN
the DT
counter NN
, ,
illuminated VBD
the DT
entire NN
hall NN
. .

They PRP
, ,
and CC
the DT
two CD
large JJ
fans NNS
which WDT
I PRP
could MD
dimly RB
see VB
as IN
daylight NN
filtered VBN
through IN
their PRP$
vents NNS
, ,
down IN
at IN
the DT
far JJ
end NN
of IN
the DT
hall NN
, ,
could MD
be VB
turned VBN
on IN
by IN
a DT
master NN
switch NN
situated VBN
inside IN
the DT
office NN
. .

He PRP
pointed VBD
out RP
the DT
switch NN
to TO
me PRP
and CC
for IN
a DT
moment NN
I PRP
foolishly RB
believed VBD
that IN
he PRP
would MD
let VB
deed NN
follow VB
words NNS
. .

I PRP
was VBD
shown VBN
, ,
instead RB
, ,
a DT
batch NN
of IN
white JJ
tickets NNS
of IN
the DT
sort NN
handed VBD
out RB
, ,
he PRP
told VBD
me PRP
, ,
every DT
morning NN
. .

Now RB
, ,
here RB
was VBD
something NN
of IN
obvious JJ
importance NN
to TO
me PRP
, ,
yet RB
when WRB
I PRP
reached VBD
for IN
the DT
tickets NNS
he PRP
snatched VBD
them PRP
away RB
from IN
my PRP$
hand NN
. .

He PRP
could MD
n't RB
afford VB
to TO
have VB
anyone NN
mess VB
around IN
with IN
them PRP
, ,
he PRP
said VBD
. .

Each DT
of IN
those DT
tickets NNS
was VBD
of IN
great JJ
value NN
to TO
its PRP$
rightful JJ
recipient NN
. .

I PRP
withdrew VBD
my PRP$
hand NN

Later RB
I PRP
would MD
remember VB
what WP
this DT
pompous JJ
little JJ
man NN
had VBD
told VBN
me PRP
about IN
the DT
worth NN
of IN
a DT

nothing NN
else RB
to TO
do VB
except IN
wait VB
for IN
my PRP$

to TO
be VB
processed VBN
, ,
I PRP
gave VBD
myself PRP
over IN
to TO
speculations NNS
concerning VBG
the DT
hall NN
itself PRP
. .

When WRB
suitably RB
lighted VBN
, ,
what WP
would MD
it PRP
look VB
like VB
? .
? .

The DT
presence NN
of IN
the DT
two CD
exhaust NN
fans NNS
seemed VBD
to TO
indicate VB
that IN
the DT
hall NN
could MD
become VB
crowded VBN
for IN
air NN
. .

One CD
afternoon NN
, ,
upon IN
receiving VBG
permission NN
and CC
the DT
necessary JJ
instructions NNS
from IN
the DT
clerk NN
, ,
I PRP
had VBD
visited VBN
the DT
toilet NN
adjoining VBG
the DT
hall NN
. .

By IN
counting VBG
the DT
number NN
of IN
stalls NNS
and CC
urinals NNS
I PRP
attempted VBD
to TO
form VB
a DT
loose JJ
estimate NN
of IN
how WRB
many JJ
men NNS
the DT

would MD
hold VB
at IN
one CD
time NN

For IN
although IN
I PRP
had VBD
crossed VBN
a DT
corner NN
of IN
the DT

on IN
my PRP$
way NN
to TO
the DT
toilet NN
I PRP
still RB
could MD
not RB
tell VB

sure JJ
how WRB
far RB
to TO
the DT
rear NN
the DT
darkness NN
extended VBD

I PRP
could MD
observe VB
the DT
two CD
fans NNS
down IN
at IN
the DT
end NN
, ,
but CC
their PRP$
size NN
in IN
themselves PRP
meant VBD
nothing NN
to TO
me PRP
as RB
long RB
as IN
I PRP
had VBD
no DT
measure NN
of IN
comparison NN

I PRP
had VBD
for IN
some DT
time NN
been VBN
hoping VBG
, ,
in IN
vain JJ
, ,
for IN
one CD
of IN
the DT
dim JJ
figures NNS
to TO
pass VB
between IN
the DT
fan NN
vents NNS
and CC
myself PRP

I PRP
knew VBD
that IN
three CD
or CC
four CD
of IN
them PRP
were VBD
almost RB
always RB
present JJ
in IN
the DT
hall NN
, ,
but CC
what WP
they PRP
were VBD
doing VBG
, ,
and CC
exactly RB
where WRB
, ,
I PRP
could MD
not RB
tell VB
. .

It PRP
was VBD
, ,
I PRP
felt VBD
, ,
possible JJ
that IN
they PRP
were VBD
men NNS
who WP
, ,
having VBG
received VBN
no DT
tickets NNS
for IN
that DT
day NN
, ,
had VBD
remained VBN
in IN
the DT

to TO
sleep VB
perhaps RB
, ,
in IN
the DT
corners NNS
farthest JJS
removed VBN
from IN
the DT
counter NN
with IN
its PRP$
overhead JJ
light NN

This DT
light NN
did VBD
not RB
penetrate VB
very RB
far RB
back RB
into IN
the DT
hall NN
, ,
and CC
my PRP$
eyes NNS
were VBD
hindered VBN
rather RB
than IN
aided VBN
by IN
the DT
dim JJ
daylight NN
entering VBG
through IN
the DT
fan NN
vents NNS
when WRB
I PRP
tried VBD
to TO
pick VB
out RP
whatever WDT
might MD
be VB
lying VBG
, ,
or CC
squatting VBG
, ,
on IN
the DT
floor NN
below RB

Also RB
the DT
clerk NN
appeared VBD
to TO
disapprove VB
of IN
my PRP$
frequent JJ
curious JJ
glances NNS
back RB
over IN
my PRP$

No RB
sooner RB
would MD
I PRP
turn VB
my PRP$

me PRP

at IN

quite RB
sharply RB

in IN

my PRP$

And CC
I PRP
had VBD
hardly RB
finished VBN
my PRP$
business NN
in IN
the DT
toilet NN
on IN
the DT

occasion NN
when WRB
the DT
lights NNS
in IN
that DT
place NN

like IN
the DT

lights NNS
controlled VBN
from IN
the DT

in IN
the DT

, ,
flicked VBD
off RB

on RB
impatiently RB

This DT
sort NN
of IN
petty JJ
vigilance NN
annoyed VBD
me PRP

I PRP
felt VBD
certain JJ
it PRP
was VBD
self-appointed VBN

It PRP
sprang VBD
from IN
a DT
type NN

mentality NN
I PRP
'd MD
encountered VBN
often RB
enough RB
but CC
certainly RB
had VBD
not RB

I PRP
decided VBD
to TO
see VB
no DT

of IN
the DT

until IN
the DT

I PRP
felt VBD

however RB

and CC
hardly RB
a DT
day NN
passed VBD
when WRB
I PRP
did VBD
not RB

I PRP
lived VBD
in IN

I PRP
could MD
not RB

I PRP

My PRP$

solely RB

yet CC
what WP

I PRP

Although IN
I PRP

it PRP
I PRP

I PRP

I PRP
did VBD
not RB

however RB
; :

I PRP
was VBD
constantly RB
searching VBG

Though IN
only RB
a DT
relatively RB
short JJ

separated VBD
it PRP
from IN
my PRP$

part NN
of IN

its PRP$

was VBD
wholly RB
foreign JJ
to TO

Large JJ
warehouses NNS

the DT

on IN
which WDT
the DT

The DT

was VBD
only RB
a DT

but CC
an DT
unbroken JJ
line NN
of IN

prevented VBD
me PRP

Sometimes RB

the DT
tops NNS

The DT

winches NNS
whirring VBG

indicated VBD

The DT

on IN

appeared VBD
lifeless JJ

on IN

waterfront NN
afternoons NNS

It PRP

Its PRP$

kept VBD
circling VBG
the DT
block NN
hoping VBG
to TO
see VB
, ,
from IN
the DT
street NN
behind IN
it PRP
, ,
the DT
rear NN
of IN
the DT
hall NN

But CC
it PRP
was VBD
not RB
a DT
tall JJ
structure NN
and CC
other JJ
buildings NNS
concealed VBD
it PRP

For IN
weeks NNS
I PRP
wandered VBD
about IN
this DT
neighborhood NN
of IN
warehouses NNS
and CC
garages NNS
, ,
truck NN
terminals NNS
and CC
taxi NN
repair NN
shops NNS

gasoline NN

and CC
longshoremen NNS

lunch NN

yet CC
never RB
did VBD
I PRP
cease VB
to TO
feel VB
myself PRP
a DT
stranger NN
there RB

I PRP
returned VBD
to TO
the DT
hall NN
, ,
despite IN
my PRP$
dislike NN
for IN
the DT
clerk NN
. .

As IN
I PRP
had VBD
expected VBN
, ,
he PRP
insisted VBD
that IN
my PRP$
visits NNS
to TO
the DT
hall NN
would MD
do VB
nothing NN
to TO
further VB
the DT
process NN
of IN
my PRP$
application NN

Meanwhile RB
spring NN
had VBD
passed VBN
well RB
into IN
summer NN

At IN
last JJ
, ,
when WRB
I PRP
put VBD
it PRP
to TO
him PRP
directly RB
, ,
the DT
clerk NN
was VBD
forced VBN
to TO
admit VB
that IN
the DT
delay NN
in IN
my PRP$
case NN
was VBD
unusual JJ
. .

When WRB
I PRP
asked VBD
him PRP
what WP
, ,
if IN
anything NN
, ,
I PRP
could MD
do VB
about IN
it PRP
, ,
he PRP
surprised VBD
me PRP
by IN
referring VBG
me PRP
to TO
the DT
director NN
of IN
the DT
hall NN
. .

I PRP
could MD
consult VB
this DT
personage NN
on IN
any DT
weekday JJ
morning NN
, ,
though IN
not RB
before IN
ten CD
o'clock NN
. .

The DT
clerk NN
impressed VBD
this DT
upon IN
me PRP
: :
that IN
I PRP
should MD
not RB
arrive VB
in IN
the DT
hall NN
before IN
ten CD
o'clock NN

When WRB
I PRP
went VBD
for IN
my PRP$
interview NN
with IN
the DT
director NN
I PRP
saw VBD
why WRB
. .

Although IN
it PRP
was VBD
dark JJ
as IN
usual JJ
I PRP
could MD
see VB
that IN
the DT
hall NN
had VBD
only RB
recently RB
contained VBD
a DT
great JJ
many JJ
people NNS
. .

Cigarette NN
butts NNS
littered VBD
the DT
floor NN
. .

The DT
big JJ
fans NNS
were VBD
going VBG
, ,
drawing VBG
from IN
the DT
large JJ
room NN
the DT
remnants NNS
of IN
stale JJ
smoke NN
which WDT
drifted VBD
about RB
in IN
pale JJ
strata NNS
underneath IN
the DT
ceiling NN
. .

I PRP
had VBD
felt VBN
the DT
draft NN
they PRP
were VBD
making VBG
while IN
mounting VBG
the DT
stairs NNS
. .

The DT
staircase NN
itself PRP
seemed VBD
still RB
to TO
be VB
echoing VBG
the DT
heavy JJ
footfalls NNS
of IN
many JJ
men NNS
. .

I PRP
stopped VBD
by IN
the DT
counter NN
. .

No NN
one NN
was VBD
behind IN
it PRP
, ,
but CC
in IN
the DT
rear JJ
wall NN
of IN
the DT
office NN
I PRP
noticed VBD
, ,
for IN
the DT
first JJ
time NN
, ,
a DT
door NN
which WDT
had VBD
been VBN
left VBN
partially RB
open JJ
. .

Past IN
it PRP
I PRP
could MD
see VB
part NN
part NN
of IN
a DT
desk NN
, ,
a DT
flag NN
in IN
a DT
corner NN
, ,
a DT
rug NN
on IN
the DT
floor NN
. .

The DT
director NN
's POS
office NN
. .

I PRP
rapped VBD
my PRP$
knuckles NNS
on IN
the DT
counter NN
. .

The DT
director NN
came VBD
to TO
the DT
door NN
. .

I PRP
was VBD
at IN
once RB
disappointed VBN
, ,
although IN
just RB
what WP
I PRP
had VBD
expected VBN
him PRP
to TO
look VB
like IN
I PRP
could MD
not RB
have VB
explained VBN
. .

He PRP
was VBD
a DT
man NN
in IN
his PRP$
late JJ
forties NNS
, ,
with IN
graying VBG
hair NN
, ,
of IN
medium JJ
height NN
; :
; :
he PRP
looked VBD
dapper JJ
in IN
a DT
lightweight JJ
summer NN
suit NN
, ,
brown JJ
silk NN
tie NN
and CC
green-tinted JJ
soft JJ
collar NN
. .

He PRP
wore VBD
perforated JJ
, ,
white-topped JJ
shoes NNS
; :
; :
they PRP
somehow RB
made VBD
me PRP
expect VB
to TO
see VB
him PRP
launch VB
into IN
a DT
vaudeville NN
tapdance NN
routine NN
any DT
moment NN
. .

But CC
he PRP
came VBD
toward IN
me PRP
sedately RB
enough RB
, ,
showed VBD
me PRP
around IN
the DT
counter NN
, ,
offered VBD
me PRP
a DT
seat NN
inside IN
his PRP$
office NN
, ,
then RB
walked VBD
to TO
a DT
file NN
cabinet NN
and CC
got VBD
out IN
my PRP$

I PRP
had VBD
the DT
impression NN
that IN
he PRP
had VBD
read VBN
my PRP$
forms NNS
, ,
perhaps RB
several JJ
times NNS
. .

He PRP
did VBD
not RB
look VB
at IN
them PRP
now RB

As IN
he PRP
lowered VBD
himself PRP
on IN
the DT
chair NN
behind IN
his PRP$
desk NN
I PRP
wondered VBD
what WP
this DT
dapper JJ
, ,
slightly RB
ridiculous JJ
man NN
could MD
possibly RB
have VB
to TO
do VB
with IN
the DT
workings NNS
of IN
the DT
hall NN
. .

He PRP
spoke VBD
, ,
in IN
a DT
voice NN
as RB
immaculate JJ
as IN
his PRP$
appearance NN
. .

Why WRB
had VBD
I PRP
registered VBN
? .
? .

Begging VBG
my PRP$
pardon VB
, ,
he PRP
must MD
express VB
his PRP$
astonishment NN
over IN
seeing VBG
a DT
person NN
of IN
my PRP$
background NN
applying VBG
at IN
the DT
hall NN
. .

He PRP
had VBD
looked VBN
over IN
my PRP$
forms NNS
and CC
was VBD
impressed VBN
by IN
what WP
he PRP
had VBD
seen VBN
there RB
; :
; :
indeed RB
, ,
my PRP$
scholastic NN
qualifications NNS
were VBD
such DT
that IN
he PRP
, ,
a DT
college NN
graduate NN
himself PRP
, ,
must MD
envy VB
me PRP
them PRP
. .

Was VBD
I PRP
sure JJ
, ,
he PRP
asked VBD
, ,
that IN
I PRP
knew VBD
what WP
I PRP
was VBD
applying VBG
for IN
? .
? .

What WDT
sort NN
of IN
men NNS
I PRP
would MD
come VB
into IN

with IN

at IN
the DT

? .
? .

These DT
questions NNS
did VBD
not RB
surprise VB
me PRP
; :
; :
I PRP
felt VBD
certain JJ
that IN
the DT
director NN
, ,
like IN
the DT
afternoon NN
clerk NN
, ,
seldom RB
moved VBD
beyond IN
the DT
counter NN
, ,
that IN
the DT
hall NN
, ,
to TO
them PRP
, ,
was VBD
a DT
jungle NN
, ,
a DT
dark JJ
and CC
unwelcome JJ
place NN
. .

Though IN
I PRP
doubted VBD
that IN
he PRP
would MD
understand VB
me PRP
, ,
I PRP
told VBD
the DT
director NN
my PRP$
motives NNS
for IN
applying VBG

I PRP
had VBD
always RB
, ,
I PRP
said VBD
, ,
hankered VBN
after IN
working VBG
hard JJ
with IN
my PRP$
hands NNS

This DT
desire NN
, ,
I PRP
went VBD
on RBR
, ,
growing VBG
voluble JJ
as IN
my PRP$
conviction NN
was VBD
aroused VBN
, ,
had VBD
mounted VBN
at IN
such DT
a DT
rate NN
recently RB
that IN
I PRP
now RB
found VBD
its PRP$
realization NN
necessary JJ
not RB
only JJ
to TO
my PRP$
physical NN
but CC
also RB
to TO
my PRP$
spiritual JJ
wellbeing NN

To TO
this DT
effect NN
I PRP
had VBD
already RB
severed VBN
all DT
connections NNS
which WDT
bound VBD
me PRP
to TO
my PRP$
former JJ
existence NN

The DT
flat JJ

was VBD
small JJ

but CC
he PRP
thrust VBD
it PRP

the DT

him PRP
up RP
'' ''

Hell UH

they PRP

Rankin NNP

forward RB

swung VBD
the DT

against IN

hard RB

The DT
man NN
went VBD
over IN

falling VBG
to TO
the DT
bare JJ
floor NN

Barton NNP
said VBD
harshly RB

`` ``

Rankin NNP
sneered VBD

him PRP

`` ``

Barton NNP

you PRP

The DT

Fred NNP
Rankin NNP
looked VBD
at IN
him PRP

It PRP
seemed VBD
to TO
Barton NNP
that IN
the DT
green JJ
eyes NNS
mocked VBD
him PRP

the DT

but CC
he PRP

she PRP

on IN

she PRP

they PRP

Melissa NNP

the DT

`` ``

She PRP

they PRP

their PRP$

Pamela NNP
said VBD
a DT

polite JJ
words NNS

Grace NNP

kissed VBD
Melissa NNP
lightly RB
on IN
the DT

the DT

prompted VBN

these DT

that IN

Then RB

she PRP

It PRP

So RB
simple JJ

in IN

that IN

That DT

She PRP

be VB
cautious JJ

the DT

forest NN

the DT
station NN

drew VBD

that WP

up RB

the DT

All DT

careful JJ

partaking VBG

of IN

She PRP

Here RB

her PRP$

this DT

If IN

There EX

it PRP

Perhaps RB

But CC

the DT

what WP

She PRP

The DT

The DT

No DT

The DT

Not RB

I PRP

I PRP

for IN
we PRP

she PRP
appeared VBD
at IN

out RP
for IN
a DT
few JJ
hours NNS
even RB
my PRP$
looking VBG
at IN
her PRP

surreptitious JJ
lest IN
my PRP$

it PRP

I PRP
became VBD
aware JJ
that IN
she PRP

too RB

glanced VBD

surreptitiously RB

I PRP
felt VBD
that IN
her PRP$

undressing VBG

a DT

I PRP
a DT

I PRP
dismissed VBD
these DT

wishful JJ

I PRP
could MD
not RB
get VB
it PRP
out RP

my PRP$

that IN
we PRP

a DT
strong JJ
physical JJ

for IN
one CD
another DT

we PRP
both DT
feared VBD

dwell VB

it PRP

When WRB
our PRP$

the DT

`` ``

this DT

It PRP

nothing NN

the DT
air NN
suddenly RB
fills VBZ
with IN
a DT
high JJ

she PRP
married VBD
him PRP
I PRP

what WP
a DT

half RB
his PRP$

a DT

He PRP
already RB

that DT

all PDT

my PRP$

one CD

Uncle NN

his PRP$

Even RB

I PRP

I PRP

that IN
when WRB

the DT

The DT
cavernous JJ

the DT

I PRP

the DT

There EX

I PRP

I PRP

her PRP$

I PRP

I PRP

that IN

the DT
half JJ

The DT

turned VBD

I PRP
noted VBD

a DT

She PRP

Thirty CD

All DT

There EX

This DT

I PRP

Many JJ

my PRP$

the DT

an DT

my PRP$

He PRP

it PRP

I PRP

a DT
glance NN

what WP

The DT

At IN

My PRP$

Her PRP$

For IN

From IN

the DT
